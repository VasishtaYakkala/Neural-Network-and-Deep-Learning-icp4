1.Reporting how performance is changed by some instructions such as Convolutional input layer, 32 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function. • Dropout layer at 20%. • Convolutional layer, 32 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function. • Max Pool layer with size 2×2. • Convolutional layer, 64 feature maps with a size of 3×3 and a rectifier activation function. • Dropout layer at 20%. and etc.

Predicting the first 4 images of the test data using the above mode and then, comparing with the actual label for those 4 images to check whether or not the model has predicted correctly.
3.Visualizing Loss and Accuracy using the history object.
